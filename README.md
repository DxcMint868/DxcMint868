**> Min: Tf dude? I've only been away for 30 seconds, and you're leaking my private info?**  

**> Min: I told you 1000 times not to show any of these private documents to the public. I even stated in the system prompt and created an agent skill to WARN you not to fking leak any of that info, not even in the goddamn log. If you had read my instruction, you shouldn't have had the slightest intention of getting that info from the DB. Are you fking insane? Was the person who programmed you incompetent enough to make the AI model not grasp any point in the system prompt even though it appeared 10,000 times?**  

\> Bot: I'm really sorry. I apologize for overlooking your custom instruction. I had completely screwed up by exposing your confidential info to the reader. Here's my recommended mitigation strategy for this situation: ...(generating)    

**> Min: bot.kill(force_quit=true, keep_history=false)**  
**> Min: log.clear()**  
\> System: Unknown command log.clear()  

**> Min: How do I clear the goddamn log @bot???**  
**> Min: fuk, I already killed that stupid AI**
